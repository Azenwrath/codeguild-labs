<h1>Alan Turing</h1>

<p>Alan Mathison Turing was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and
    theoretical biologist.</p>

    <h5>"May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from
        what a man does?"</h5>
    <p>Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of
        the
        concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general
        purpose
        computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial
        intelligence. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Source</a>)

    <p>Turing's work resulted in a number of concepts being named after them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good-Turing frequency estimation</li>
        <li>Turing completeness</li>
        <li>Turing degree</li>
        <li>Turing Institute</li>
        <li>Turing Lecture</li>
        <li>Turing machine</li>
        <li>Turing patterns</li>
        <li>Turing reduction</li>
        <li>Turing switch</li>
